# CloudDrive-Cloud-Storage-System-
A secure cloud storage prototype built with Python that allows users to upload and store personal documents with end-to-end encryption. Files are encrypted in such a way that they cannot be viewed from the backend â€” only the authenticated user can access and decrypt their data through their login credentials.
